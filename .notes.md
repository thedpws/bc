# Send to joey. AST example in java

# Scopes

Global scope + function scoping (for recursion)




Antlr produces the .java files
We can add our own Main files plus other source files
 => produce a complete java project

 In main
     Instantiate the parser
     run the parser
     when parser is done, say give me access to the parse tree
        Parse tree is built no matter what. It's automatically built

# AST
Think about what happens in OCaml
    sum types that capture structure (java cannot)
    What should AST look like? A: What OCaml does
    Our goal is to add java boilerplate to make it act like OCaml

    The 3 types are the AST: a complete AST representation

    Do a 1:1 mapping from Ocaml to java 
        Do classes
        Do getters and setters

    If statement would be given 3 parameters

    Make a base class for statement and then specialize

    Interpreter - walk through structure

    role of parser - capture structure
    interpreter - walk thru structure
